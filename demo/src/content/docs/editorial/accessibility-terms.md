<!-- vale off -->

Don’t use language that defines people by their disability, such as disabled, impaired, and the deaf.  
A person might have a visual impairment, but that person isn’t impaired.

## Examples

Person with visual impairment, person who is blind

Person with hearing loss, person with deafness

Person who is nonverbal, person who uses sign language

Person who uses a wheelchair

Person with a prosthetic limb, person without a limb

Person with autism

Person of small stature

see the [Guidelines for Inclusive Language](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/guidelines-inclusive-language "Link to Linguistic Society") from the Linguistic Society of America.
